# bulkrename is a program which can take your .txt and jpg's and put them into a new, sorted folder. 
# No actual data will change when you copy them over, they'll just have their names changed.
# usage: python3 bulk-rename.py (file)/(path)
# The new folder will be created alongside the program, so it's probably best to just move bulk-rename with the folder you want to duplicate. ALthough it's not necessary.

# An image and text file is held alongside to do some testing with.
